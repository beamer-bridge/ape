One of the best feature of Ape is our modular plugin system. Our plugins is the way we want you to have most interoperable experience with Web Ecosystem.

[Plugin list]()

### Quick Start 

After you installed Ape and you want to get started, you generally will work with a project and need the proper scaffolding. 
To quickly get started using ape, generate a project using the `ape init`command:

```bash
ape init
```

For more in-depth information about smart-contract projects using the Ape framework, see the [projects guide](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/projects.html).

### Accounts

In Ape, you will need accounts to make transactions.
You can import or generate accounts using the core `accounts` plugin:

```bash
ape accounts import acc0   # Will prompt for a private key
ape accounts generate acc1
```

List all your accounts with the `list` command.

```bash
ape accounts list
```

Learn more about accounts in Ape by following the [accounts guide](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/accounts.html).

### Plugins

Add any plugins you may need, such as `vyper`.

```bash
ape plugins list -a
ape plugins install vyper
ape plugins list -a
```

**NOTE**: If a plugin does not originate from the [ApeWorX GitHub organization](https://github.com/ApeWorX?q=ape&type=all), you will get a warning about installing 3rd-party plugins.
Install 3rd party plugins at your own risk.
Additionally, plugins that come bundled with `ape` in the core installation cannot be removed and are part of the `ape` core software.

Learn more about installing plugins from following [this guide](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/installing_plugins.html).
Learn more about developing your own plugins from [this guide](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/projects.html).

### Compiling

You can compile contracts within the `contracts/` directory of your project.
The `--size` option will display you the size of the contract.

```bash
ape compile --size
```

Learn more about compiling in Ape by following the [compile guide](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/compile.html).

### Testing

Use Ape to test your smart-contract projects.
Provide the same arguments to `pytest` as you would to the `ape test` command.

For example:

```bash
ape test -k test_only_one_thing
```

Visit the [testing guide](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/testing.html) to learn more about testing using Ape.

### Console

Ape provides an `IPython` interactive console with useful pre-defined locals to interact with your project.
To interact with a deployed contract in a local environment, start by opening the console:

```bash
ape console --network ethereum:mainnet:infura
```

Visit [Ape Console](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/commands/console.html) to learn how to use Ape Console.

### Scripts

If you want to run specific files in a `scripts/` directory, you can do it using the `ape run` command.

```bash
# This command will run a file named deploy in the scripts/ directory
$ ape run deploy
```

Learn more about scripting using Ape by following the [scripting guide](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/userguides/scripts.html).

### Logging

To enable debug logging, run your command with the `--verbosity` flag using `DEBUG` as the value:

```bash
ape --verbosity DEBUG run
```

### Networks

You can work with registered networks, providers, and blockchain ecosystems (like Ethereum):

```python
from ape import networks
with networks.ethereum.mainnet.use_provider("infura"):
    ...  # Work with the infura provider here
```

To learn more about networks in Ape, see [this guide](https://docs.apeworx.io/ape/stable/commands/networks.html).
